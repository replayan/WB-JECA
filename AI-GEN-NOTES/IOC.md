# Introduction to Computers

## 1. Bus Structure
### Definition
A **Bus** is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.

### Types of Buses
- **Data Bus**: Transfers data between the CPU and memory or between other devices.
- **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses from the CPU to memory modules.
- **Control Bus**: Carries control signals to coordinate activity between components.

### Example
In a computer system, the CPU communicates with the memory through the data bus and the address bus.

## 2. Basic I/O (Input/Output)
### Definition
**Input/Output (I/O)** refers to the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer) and the outside world.

### Types of I/O Devices
- **Keyboard**
- **Mouse**
- **Monitor/Display**
- **Printer**
- **Disk Drives**
- **Network Interface Cards (NIC)**

### I/O Operations
- **Polling**: The CPU continuously checks the status of an I/O device.
- **Interrupts**: The I/O device interrupts the CPU when it is ready to transfer data.
- **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: Allows I/O devices to transfer data directly to/from memory without CPU intervention.

## 3. Subroutines
### Definition
**Subroutines**, also known as functions or procedures, are blocks of code that can be called and executed multiple times from different parts of a program.

### Advantages
- **Modularity**: Breaks down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
- **Reusability**: Code can be reused without duplication.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and update.

### Example
```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

# Calling the subroutine
result = calculate_area(5, 3)
print("Area:", result)
```

## 4. Interrupt
### Definition
An **Interrupt** is a signal from a device attached to a computer or from a program within the computer that requires the CPU to stop executing its current task and attend to the interrupting device.

### Types of Interrupts
- **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by external hardware devices.
- **Software Interrupts**: Generated by programs to request services from the operating system.
- **Trap**: A software-generated interrupt caused by an error condition or a specific instruction.

### Example
When a user presses a key on the keyboard, it generates a hardware interrupt, causing the CPU to stop its current task and process the keyboard input.

## 5. DMA (Direct Memory Access)
### Definition
**Direct Memory Access (DMA)** is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory (RAM) independently of the central processing unit (CPU).

### Advantages
- **Faster Data Transfer**: DMA transfers data directly between devices and memory without involving the CPU, making it faster.
- **Offloading CPU**: Frees up the CPU to perform other tasks while data is being transferred.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces latency and overhead associated with CPU-managed transfers.

### Example
When transferring a large file from a disk drive to memory, DMA can be used to transfer data directly from the disk controller to memory, bypassing the CPU.

## 6. RAM (Random Access Memory)
### Definition
**Random Access Memory (RAM)** is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly, meaning any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes.

### Types of RAM
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: Requires periodic refresh cycles to maintain data integrity.
- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more expensive than DRAM, does not require refresh cycles.
- **DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate Synchronous DRAM)**: Commonly used in modern computers for higher bandwidth.

### Example
In a computer system, RAM is used to temporarily store data and program instructions that are actively being used by the CPU.

---

## 7. ROM (Read-Only Memory)
### Definition
**Read-Only Memory (ROM)** is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data permanently and cannot be modified after manufacture.

### Types of ROM
- **Mask ROM**: Manufactured with data permanently encoded during fabrication.
- **EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**: Can be erased and reprogrammed using UV light.
- **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)**: Can be erased and reprogrammed electrically.

### Example
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) in a computer is typically stored in ROM, providing essential functions such as booting up the system.

---

## 8. Pipeline
### Definition
**Pipeline** is a technique in which multiple instructions are overlapped during execution, with each instruction broken down into a series of sequential stages.

### Pipeline Stages
- **Instruction Fetch**: Fetch the next instruction from memory.
- **Instruction Decode**: Decode the instruction and determine its type.
- **Execution**: Execute the instruction (e.g., ALU operation).
- **Memory Access**: Access memory if needed (e.g., load/store).
- **Write Back**: Write the result back to a register.

### Example
In a CPU pipeline, while one instruction is being executed, the next instruction can be fetched, and the instruction after that can be decoded, leading to better utilization of CPU resources and improved performance.

## 9. System Calls
### Definition
**System Calls** are requests made by a program to the operating system or kernel for performing various operations, such as input/output, process management, and memory management.

### Common System Calls
- **Open**: Open a file or device.
- **Read**: Read data from a file or device.
- **Write**: Write data to a file or device.
- **Close**: Close a file or device.
- **Fork**: Create a new process (on Unix-like systems).
- **Exec**: Replace the current process with a new one.

### Example
When a program running on a computer needs to read data from a file, it makes a system call to the operating system's file management system to perform the read operation.
