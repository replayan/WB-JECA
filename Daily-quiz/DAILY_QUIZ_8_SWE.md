1. **Which of the following is worst type of cohesion?**
   - a) Sequential cohesion
   - b) Coincidental cohesion ✔️
   - c) Functional cohesion
   - d) Logical cohesion

   Explanation: Coincidental cohesion is considered the worst type of cohesion because it involves elements grouped together arbitrarily, with no meaningful relationship. It indicates poor design and can lead to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and modify.

2. **CASE stands for**
   - a) Computer-Aided Software Engineering ✔️
   - b) Control Aided Science and Engineering
   - c) Cost Aided System Experiments
   - d) None of the mentioned

   Explanation: CASE stands for Computer-Aided Software Engineering, which refers to the use of computer-based tools and techniques in software development.

3. **Which of the following is White Box testing technique?**
   - a) Path coverage ✔️
   - b) Equivalence Class testing
   - c) Cause Effect Graphing
   - d) State-based testing

   Explanation: Path coverage is a White Box testing technique where test cases are designed to execute all possible paths in a program's control flow.

4. **Software is defined as ....**
   - a) Set of programs, documentation & configuration of data ✔️
   - b) Set of programs
   - c) Documentation and configuration of data
   - d) None of the mentioned

   Explanation: Software encompasses not only the programs themselves but also the accompanying documentation and configuration of data required for the programs to function properly.

5. **SDLC stands for?**
   - a) Software Development Linear Cycle
   - b) System Development Life Cycle 
   - c) Software Development Life Cycle ✔️
   - d) Systematic Deployment Life Cycle

   Explanation: SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured process for developing software. It consists of phases like planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. The SDLC helps ensure software meets requirements and is delivered efficiently. It provides a systematic approach to software development.
