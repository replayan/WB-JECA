1. What is the default visibility mode for class members in object-oriented programming?
   - [ ] public
   - [x] private
   - [ ] protected
   - [ ] anywhere

   Explanation: By default, class members in object-oriented programming are private. This means they are accessible only within the class itself and not from outside the class.

2. Which is the correct syntax for extern variable declaration?
   - [x] extern data_type variable_name;
   - [ ] extern variable_name;
   - [ ] data_type variable_name extern;
   - [ ] extern (data_type)variable_name;

   Explanation: The correct syntax for an extern variable declaration in C++ is to use the `extern` keyword followed by the data type and the variable name. This syntax explicitly declares that the variable is defined externally, and its definition will be found elsewhere in the program.

3. Late binding, or dynamic binding, is implemented in object-oriented programming through:
   - [x] virtual functions
   - [ ] operator functions
   - [ ] const functions
   - [ ] static functions

   Explanation: Late binding, also known as dynamic binding, is implemented in object-oriented programming through virtual functions. Virtual functions allow the appropriate function implementation to be determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object being referred to.

4. When is a constructor called in C++?
   - [ ] At the time of declaration of a class
   - [x] At the time of declaration of an object
   - [ ] At the time of use of a class
   - [ ] At the time of use of an object

   Explanation: Constructors in C++ are special member functions that are called when an object of a class is created. Therefore, a constructor is called at the time of declaration of an object.

5. Which of the following correctly describes overloading of functions?
   - [ ] Virtual polymorphism
   - [ ] Transient polymorphism
   - [x] Ad-hoc polymorphism
   - [ ] Pseudo polymorphism

   Explanation: Overloading of functions refers to the ability to define multiple functions in the same scope with the same name but different parameter lists. This is also known as ad-hoc polymorphism, where the appropriate function to call is determined by the number and types of arguments provided.
