1. **In a binary search tree, which of the following traversals would print the numbers in ascending order?**
   - [ ] Level-order traversal
   - [ ] Pre-order traversal
   - [ ] Post-order traversal
   - [x] In-order traversal

   Explanation: In a binary search tree (BST), the in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order because it first traverses the left subtree (which contains smaller elements), then the current node, and finally the right subtree (which contains larger elements).

2. **Which of the following is not an application of a stack?**
   - [ ] A parentheses balancing program
   - [ ] Tracking of local variables at runtime
   - [ ] Compiler Syntax Analyzer
   - [x] Data Transfer between two asynchronous processes

   Explanation: Stacks are not typically used for data transfer between asynchronous processes. Instead, other data structures like queues or buffers are commonly employed for this purpose.

3. **In a stack, if a user tries to remove an element from an empty stack, it is called _______.**
   - [x] Underflow
   - [ ] Empty collection
   - [ ] Overflow
   - [ ] Garbage Collection

   Explanation: When attempting to remove an element from an empty stack, it results in an underflow condition. Underflow occurs when an operation is performed on an empty data structure.

4. **In the binary tree data structure, using the depth-first approach, preorder traversal means _______.**
   - [x] Root -> Left-Subtree -> Right-Subtree
   - [ ] Left-Subtree -> Root -> Right-Subtree
   - [ ] Left-Subtree -> Right-Subtree -> Root
   - [ ] Left-Subtree -> Right-Subtree

   Explanation: Preorder traversal visits the root node first, then recursively visits the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. This results in a traversal order of Root -> Left-Subtree -> Right-Subtree.

5. **In a tree where for every node the height of its left subtree and right subtree differ at least by one, what is it called?**
   - [ ] Binary search tree
   - [x] AVL tree
   - [ ] Threaded binary tree
   - [ ] Complete tree

   Explanation: Such a tree is called an AVL tree. AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring the tree remains balanced.
