### 1. Which is a measure of the degree of interdependence between modules?
- A) Cohesion
- B) Coupling
- C) All
- D) None

**Answer: B) Coupling**

**Explanation:** Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. Lower coupling is desirable as it indicates that modules are more independent, making the system easier to maintain and modify. Cohesion, on the other hand, measures how closely related the functions within a single module are.

### 3. The activity that distributes estimated effort across the planned project duration by allocating the effort to specific software development tasks is ....
- A) Project scheduling
- B) Detailed schedule
- C) Macroscopic schedule
- D) None of the mentioned

**Answer: A) Project scheduling**

**Explanation:** Project scheduling involves creating a detailed plan that outlines all the tasks required to complete a project, the sequence of these tasks, the estimated time each task will take, and the allocation of resources to these tasks. This helps in managing the project efficiently and keeping it on track.

### 4. A good software requirement specification does not have the _____ characteristic.
- A) Completeness
- B) Consistency
- C) Clarity
- D) Reliability

### 5. The user system requirements are the parts of which document?
- A) SDD (Software Design Document)
- B) SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
- C) DDD (Detailed Design Document)
- D) SRD (System Requirements Document)

**Answer: B) SRS (Software Requirements Specification)**

**Explanation:** The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document includes detailed descriptions of the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system, including the user system requirements. It serves as a comprehensive guide to what the system should do from the user's perspective.
