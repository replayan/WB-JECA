# Computer Network Quiz

1. **In a network, a ______ device can transmit data in a bi-directional way at a particular time instance.**
   - a) simplex
   - b) half duplex
   - c) multiplex
   - d) full duplex
   
   **Answer: d) full duplex**
   Explanation: 
   Full duplex devices can transmit data in both directions simultaneously, allowing for bi-directional communication without the need for time-sharing.

2. **In OSI network architecture, the dialogue control and token management are responsibilities of**
   - a) session layer
   - b) network layer
   - c) transport layer
   - d) data link layer
   
   **Answer: a) session layer**
   Explanation: 
   The session layer manages dialogue control and token management, including the establishment, maintenance, and termination of sessions between communicating nodes.

3. **In computer network, ______ helps to find out the hardware address of a host from its known IP address.**
   - a) Address Resolution Protocol
   - b) Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
   - c) Simple Network Management Protocol
   - d) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
   
   **Answer: a) Address Resolution Protocol**
   Explanation: 
   The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, facilitating communication between devices on the same network segment.

4. **In IPv6 addresses, addresses that start with eight 0s are called ________**
   - a) Unicast addresses
   - b) Multicast addresses
   - c) Anycast addresses
   - d) Reserved addresses
   
   **Answer: d) Reserved addresses**
   Explanation: 
   IPv6 addresses starting with eight 0s are reserved for special purposes defined by the IPv6 specification and are not assigned for normal communication.

5. **Which of the following devices is used to connect two systems, especially if the systems use different protocols?**
   - a) hub
   - b) bridge
   - c) gateway
   - d) repeater
   
   **Answer: c) gateway**
   Explanation: 
   Gateways are used to connect systems using different protocols, operating at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model to translate data between different communication protocols.
