## Multiple Choice Questions:

### 1. Which of the following is not a type of database?

- A) Hierarchical
- B) Network
- C) Distributed
- D) Decentralized

**Answer:** D) Decentralized

**Explanation:** 
Decentralized is not a type of database. Hierarchical, Network, and Distributed are types of databases. Decentralized systems refer to systems where control is distributed among multiple nodes, often used in the context of blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

### 2. Which of the following is known as minimal super key?

- A) Primary key
- B) Candidate key
- C) Foreign key
- D) None

**Answer:** B) Candidate key

**Explanation:** 
A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it is the smallest possible subset of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table. A primary key is a special type of candidate key, and a foreign key is used to establish a link between the data in two tables.

### 3. Which key can be derived directly from a Super Key?

- A) Primary key
- B) Foreign key
- C) Candidate key
- D) Database key

**Answer:** C) Candidate key

**Explanation:** 
A candidate key is derived directly from a super key. It is a minimal super key, meaning it has no unnecessary attributes and can still uniquely identify a record in a table.

### 4. Relation R has eight attributes ABCDEFGH. FD={CH->G, A->BC, B->CFH, E->A, F->EG}. How many candidate keys in R?

- A) 3
- B) 4
- C) 5
- D) 6

**Answer:** B) 4

**Explanation:** 
The candidate keys for the relation R with the given functional dependencies are found by determining the minimal sets of attributes that can uniquely determine all other attributes. The candidate keys are \( ED, FD, BD, \) and \( ADF \), making a total of 4 candidate keys.

### 5. What is the default sorting order of ORDER BY clause?

- A) ascending
- B) descending
- C) no default sorting order is there
- D) None of the above

**Answer:** A) ascending

**Explanation:** 
The default sorting order of the ORDER BY clause is ascending. If you do not specify the sorting order (ASC for ascending or DESC for descending), the results are sorted in ascending order by default.
