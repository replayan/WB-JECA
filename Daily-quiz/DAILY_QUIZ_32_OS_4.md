## Multiple Choice Questions:

1. **Fork is**
   - a) the dispatching of a task
   - b) the creation of a new job
   - c) the creation of a new process
   - d) increasing the priority of a task
   
   **Answer:** c) the creation of a new process
   
   **Explanation:** Forking typically refers to the creation of a new process in computing lingo. When a process "forks," it essentially duplicates itself, creating a new process with an identical copy of the original program's code and data.

2. **Which algorithm is defined in Time quantum?**
   - a) shortest job scheduling algorithm
   - b) round robin scheduling algorithm
   - c) priority scheduling algorithm
   - d) multilevel queue scheduling algorithm
   
   **Answer:** b) round robin scheduling algorithm
   
   **Explanation:** The scheduling algorithm defined by a time quantum is the "Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm." In Round Robin scheduling, each process is assigned a fixed time slice, often referred to as a "time quantum."

3. **Logical memory is broken into blocks of the same size called ______**
   - a) Pages
   - b) Frames
   - c) Backing store
   - d) None of the above
   
   **Answer:** a) Pages
   
   **Explanation:** Logical memory is typically broken into blocks of the same size called "Pages." These pages are used in the context of virtual memory management.

4. **The FCFS algorithm is particularly troublesome for ____________**
   - a) operating systems
   - b) multiprocessor systems
   - c) time sharing systems
   - d) multiprogramming systems
   
   **Answer:** c) time sharing systems
   
   **Explanation:** The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm is particularly troublesome for time sharing systems because it doesn't prioritize tasks based on their urgency or importance.

5. **The number of processes completed per unit time is known as __________**
   - a) Output
   - b) Throughput
   - c) Efficiency
   - d) Capacity
   
   **Answer:** b) Throughput
   
   **Explanation:** Throughput is a measure of the system's efficiency and its ability to process tasks within a given time frame. It's often used to evaluate the performance of systems such as computer networks, CPUs, and other processing systems.
