## Multiple Choice Questions:

1. Which of the following computer memory is fastest?
   - [ ] Hard disk
   - [x] Register
   - [ ] RAM
   - [ ] None of the above

   **Explanation:** Registers are the fastest type of computer memory as they are located within the CPU itself, providing the quickest access for data storage and retrieval during program execution. Registers are used to hold data and addresses for the current instruction being executed, as well as temporary results.

2. Which of the following is used in an optical mouse?
   - [ ] Infrared light
   - [x] Light Emitting Diode (LED)
   - [ ] Sensor
   - [ ] Microwave

   **Explanation:** Optical mice use an LED (Light Emitting Diode) to illuminate the surface underneath the mouse. A sensor in the mouse detects the pattern of light reflected from the surface, allowing it to track the movement of the mouse. The sensor captures the changes in the reflected light pattern as the mouse moves, translating the movement into cursor motion on the screen.

3. What is the size of the computer accumulator register?
   - [ ] 4 bit
   - [ ] 4 KB
   - [ ] 4 byte
   - [x] 8 byte

   **Explanation:** In most modern computer architectures, the accumulator register, which is used for arithmetic and logical operations, is typically 8 bytes or 64 bits in size. The accumulator is a central register that holds the operands and results of arithmetic and logical operations performed by the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) of the processor.

4. Address of the next instruction to be executed is specified by:
   - [ ] MBR (Memory Buffer Register)
   - [ ] MAR (Memory Address Register)
   - [ ] PSW (Program Status Word)
   - [x] PC (Program Counter)

   **Explanation:** The program counter (PC) is a register in a computer processor that stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. Its role is to keep track of where the computer is in its program sequence so that it knows where to fetch the next instruction from memory. The PC is incremented after each instruction is fetched and executed, pointing to the next instruction's address.

5. Which of the following is used in main memory?
   - [ ] DDR-RAM
   - [x] DRAM
   - [ ] SRAM
   - [ ] PRAM

   **Explanation:** DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) is the type of memory commonly used for a computer's main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory). It provides reasonably fast data access and is more cost-effective than faster memory types like SRAM for use as a system's main memory.

   DDR-RAM refers to specific DRAM types like DDR-SDRAM (Double Data Rate Sdram) which transfer data faster, but still falls under the broader category of DRAM.
   SRAM (Static RAM) is faster but more expensive, so used for CPU caches rather than main RAM.
   PRAM (Phase Change RAM) is a newer non-volatile memory type not yet widely adopted for main memory.
