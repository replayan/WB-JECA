## Multiple Choice Questions:

1. **Which of the following machine learning techniques helps in detecting the outliers in data?**
   - Classification
   - Clustering
   - Anomaly detection
   - All of the above
   
   **Answer: Anomaly detection**
   
   Explanation: Anomaly detection specifically focuses on identifying outliers in data by distinguishing unusual patterns or instances from normal behavior. While clustering can sometimes identify outliers indirectly, anomaly detection is specifically designed for this purpose.

2. **In hierarchical clustering, CF tree is _______ tree which stores clustering features.**
   - weight balanced
   - width balanced
   - height balanced
   - not a balanced
   
   **Answer: height balanced**
   
   Explanation: In hierarchical clustering, CF tree (Clustering Feature tree) is typically structured as a height balanced tree. This balance ensures efficient storage and retrieval of clustering features within the hierarchical clustering framework.

3. **Which of the following algorithms is used for dimensionality reduction?**
   - K-Means
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes
   - PCA
   
   **Answer: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
   
   Explanation: PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while preserving as much variance as possible. It identifies the principal components that explain the maximum variance in the data and projects the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace.

4. **Which of the following is a widely used and effective ML algorithm based on the idea of bagging?**
   - Decision tree
   - Random forest
   - Regression
   - Classification
   
   **Answer: Random forest**
   
   Explanation: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that utilizes bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) to train multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data. It combines the predictions of these trees to improve accuracy and robustness in both classification and regression tasks.
