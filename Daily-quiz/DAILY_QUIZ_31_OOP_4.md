## Multiple Choice Questions:

1. **Which of the following cannot be friend?**
    - Function
    - Class
    - Object
    - Operator function

    **Correct Answer:** Object

    **Explanation:** In C++, the concept of "friend" is used to allow certain functions or classes to access the private and protected members of another class. Friendship can be applied to functions, classes, and operator functions, but not to specific objects.

2. **How to overcome the diamond problem?**
    - Using separate derived class
    - Using virtual keyword with same name function
    - Canâ€™t be done
    - Using alias name

    **Correct Answer:** Using virtual keyword with same name function

    **Explanation:** The diamond problem in C++ is resolved by using virtual inheritance. This ensures that the base class is only included once in the derived class hierarchy, avoiding ambiguity.

3. **Which access specifier is usually used for data members of a class?**
    - Protected
    - Private
    - Public
    - Default

    **Correct Answer:** Private

    **Explanation:** In C++, data members of a class are usually declared as private to enforce encapsulation. This means that the data members are accessible only within the class itself and not from outside the class.

4. **____ member variables are initialized to zero when the first object of its class is created?**
    - Static
    - Local
    - Global
    - External

    **Correct Answer:** Static

    **Explanation:** Static member variables in C++ are initialized to zero when the first object of the class is created. Static variables retain their value across all instances of the class.

5. **How many types of access specifiers are provided in OOP (C++)?**
    - 4
    - 2
    - 3
    - 1

    **Correct Answer:** 3

    **Explanation:** C++ provides three types of access specifiers: public, protected, and private. These specifiers control the accessibility of class members.
