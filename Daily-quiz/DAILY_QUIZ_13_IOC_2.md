1. **Which method is used to establish priority by serially connecting all devices that request an interrupt?**
   - a. Vectored-interrupting
   - b. Daisy chain
   - c. Priority
   - d. Polling
   
   **Correct Answer: b. Daisy chain**
   
   **Explanation:** In a daisy chain interrupt system, devices are connected in series, forming a chain. When an interrupt request occurs, the controller processes the interrupts in the order they are received along the chain, allowing devices with higher priority to be placed earlier in the chain.

2. **Which of the following is used in main memory?**
   - a. DDR-RAM
   - b. DRAM
   - c. SRAM
   - d. PRAM
   
   **Correct Answer: b. DRAM**
   
   **Explanation:** DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) is typically used in main memory. It stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit.

3. **Which of the following computer generations brought about the introduction of transistors?**
   - a. First Generation
   - b. Second Generation
   - c. Third Generation
   - d. Fourth Generation
   
   **Correct Answer: b. Second Generation**
   
   **Explanation:** The second generation of computers introduced transistors, which replaced vacuum tubes, resulting in smaller, faster, and more reliable computers.

4. **What does the last instruction of each subroutine that transfers the control to the instruction in the calling program with temporary address storage, called as?**
   - a. Jump to subroutine
   - b. Branch to subroutine
   - c. Return from subroutine
   - d. Call subroutine
   
   **Correct Answer: c. Return from subroutine**
   
   **Explanation:** The last instruction of a subroutine that transfers control back to the calling program is typically called "return from subroutine" or "return." It returns the program execution flow to the point immediately following the call to the subroutine in the calling program.

5. **Which component was the foundation of the first generation of computers?**
   - a. ICs (Integrated Circuits)
   - b. Transistors
   - c. Microprocessors
   - d. Vacuum tubes
   
   **Correct Answer: d. Vacuum tubes**
   
   **Explanation:** The first generation of computers was based on vacuum tubes. These vacuum tubes were used as electronic switches and amplifiers in early computers to perform logic operations and store data.
