### 1. Which of the following computer memory is fastest?
- A) Register
- B) Hard disk
- C) RAM
- D) None of the above

**Correct Answer: A) Register**

**Explanation:**
Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU. They are the fastest type of memory because they are directly accessible by the CPU. RAM is slower than registers, and hard disks are much slower than both.

### 2. Which of the following is not an operating system?
- A) Windows
- B) Linux
- C) Oracle
- D) DOS

**Correct Answer: C) Oracle**

**Explanation:**
Windows, Linux, and DOS are all operating systems. Oracle, on the other hand, is primarily known for its database management systems, not as an operating system.

### 3. The interrupt which cannot be delayed and requires the processor to process them immediately is ______
- A) Maskable interrupts
- B) Non-Maskable interrupts
- C) Software interrupts
- D) Periodic interrupts

**Correct Answer: B) Non-Maskable interrupts**

**Explanation:**
Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs) are high-priority interrupts that cannot be ignored or delayed by the CPU. They are used for critical events that require immediate attention, such as hardware failures.

### 4. Which of the following is not a type of computer code?
- A) EDIC
- B) ASCII
- C) BCD
- D) EBCDIC

**Correct Answer: A) EDIC**

**Explanation:**
ASCII, BCD, and EBCDIC are all types of computer codes used for encoding text and numbers. EDIC is not a recognized type of computer code.

### 5. The pipelining process is also called as ______
- A) Superscalar operation
- B) Assembly line operation
- C) Von Neumann cycle
- D) None of the mentioned

**Correct Answer: B) Assembly line operation**

**Explanation:**
Pipelining is often referred to as an assembly line operation because it processes instructions in stages, similar to how an assembly line processes products step-by-step. This allows for more efficient instruction processing within a CPU.
