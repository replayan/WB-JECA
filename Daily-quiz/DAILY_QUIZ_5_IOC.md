## 1. The technique where the controller is given complete access to main memory is __________

Options:
- Cycle stealing
- Memory stealing
- Memory Con
- Burst mode

The correct answer is **Memory stealing**.

Explanation: Memory stealing is a technique in computer architecture where a device controller, such as a DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller, is given direct access to main memory without having to go through the CPU. This allows the controller to transfer data to and from memory independently, enhancing overall system performance.

## 2. The size of virtual memory is based on which of the following?

Options:
- CPU
- RAM
- Address bus
- Data bus

The correct answer is **Address bus**.

Explanation: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an illusion to users of a very large memory space. The size of virtual memory is primarily determined by the size of the address bus, which defines the maximum addressable memory locations that the CPU can access.

## 3. Which of the following is the smallest unit of data in a computer?

Options:
- Bit
- KB
- Nibble
- Byte

The correct answer is **Bit**.

Explanation: A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer and represents a binary digit, which can have a value of either 0 or 1. All other data units, such as bytes, kilobytes, and nibbles, are composed of multiple bits.

## 4. The technique whereby the DMA controller steals the access cycles of the processor to operate is called

Options:
- Fast conning
- Memory Con
- Cycle stealing
- Memory stealing

The correct answer is **Cycle stealing**.

Explanation: Cycle stealing is a technique used by DMA controllers to transfer data between devices and memory without involving the CPU. During cycle stealing, the DMA controller temporarily halts the CPU and steals access cycles to perform data transfers, thereby improving overall system efficiency.

## 5. The signal sent to the device from the processor to the device after receiving an interrupt is

Options:
- Interrupt-acknowledge
- Return signal
- Service signal
- Permission signal

The correct answer is **Interrupt-acknowledge**.

Explanation: After receiving an interrupt signal from a device, the processor sends an interrupt-acknowledge signal to the device to indicate that the interrupt request has been received and acknowledged. This signal allows the device to proceed with the interrupt handling process.
